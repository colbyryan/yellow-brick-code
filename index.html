          <h2>The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film</h2>
          <p>
            The Wizard of Oz is the source of many quotes referenced in
            contemporary popular culture. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and
            Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others
            made uncredited contributions. The songs were written by Edgar "Yip"
            Harburg and composed by Harold Arlen. The musical score and
            incidental music were composed by Herbert Stothart.

              L. Frank Baum's beloved children's book "The Wonderful Wizard of
              Oz" has been adapted in various forms over the years, but at this
              point we have no idea what version to expect from director Nicole
              Kassell.
